Tell whether a given wav has gone through lossy encoding in its lifetime.

/The API is unstable and will change, focusing on getting the results right for
now./

Eh needs examples of pure lossless audios of your use case (the use case
shouldn't matter much but this has to be validated) and a list of potential
filters. Then it trains a model to predict whether a new set of audios is
lossless (1) or not (0).

#+begin_src shell
Eh!

Usage:
  eh train --audio-dir=<audio-dir> --config-yaml=<config-yaml> --output-model=<output-model>
  eh --audio-dir=<audio-dir> --model=<model> --output-csv=<output-csv>
#+end_src

Sample config is provided in ~./resources/~ directory.
