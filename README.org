Lossless or Lossy. =lol= tells whether a given wav has gone through lossy encoding
in its lifetime.

=lol= needs examples of pure lossless audios of your use case (the use case
shouldn't matter much but this has to be validated) and a list of potential
audio transforms. Then it trains a model to predict whether a new set of audios
is lossless (1) or not (0).

#+begin_src shell
lol

Usage:
  lol train --audio-dir=<audio-dir> --transforms-yaml=<transforms-yaml> --output-model=<output-model>
  lol --audio-dir=<audio-dir> --model=<model> --output-csv=<output-csv>
#+end_src

Sample transforms config is provided in ~./resources/~ directory.
